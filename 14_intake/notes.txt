DISCO:
* The print statement in the testmod0.py file automatically ran when importing the module
* printing app printed the flask object
* printing request will link the server address at which the html is being hosted
* I think the request args prints out whatever arguements are sent to the website as we did before
* but since there is no arguements being passed, it printed out an empty array []
* printing request.args['username'] will give the PSOD because there is no argument called username 
* being passed to the template html, causing an error
* I am able to run the goo function from testmod0 through printing through the console

Q/C/C:
* What does the information I received from printing the header of the request
* mean? I am not sure what most of it means but I see stuff like
* Google Chrome and Windows which is the browser and operating system I am currently using
* What does the "methods = ['GET', 'POST']" next to the app.route do?
* Does it even do anything?
* How do I get the other function in testmod0 to print? 
* I am not sure how to not import the file but also allow app.py to access
* the things in testmod0.py. I tried doing test = testmod0() but that didn't work
